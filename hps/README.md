# HPS

Originally named Hammer Position Sensor (HPS).

However,
* these sensors are also used for dampers and
* new additional sensor systems will be added to the *sensor-systems* repository. 

Therefore, HPS is simply a label for one of the possible sensor systems. It does not have the original meaning anymore.
